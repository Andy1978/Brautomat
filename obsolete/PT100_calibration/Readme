put both sensors (PT100 and DS18B20) into boiling water, run pt100cal with
./pt100cal | tee yourlogfile.log

log the temperature decreasing and then process it in octave

captures/100deg_1.log.gz
  was a first fast polling measurement without timestamp
  and suffered from a int16 overflow (sum filter was too big)

captures/100deg_2.log 
  second capture with temperatures from 95째C .. -5째C (ice and salt)
  huber_D150_2.log is the corresponding, manual captured reference

captures/100deg_3.log 
  third capture in isolated mug and temperatures from 95째C..13.3째C
  huber_D150_3.log is the corresponding, manual captured reference
